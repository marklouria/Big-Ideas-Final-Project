## Abstract
  We researched the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the metric of what is the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh for kids. The three of us used fire incidents, speed humps, and playground equipment as the metric of the study. We found that from all areas, Suirrel Hill South was at or near the top for all the categories. From this, we made the conclusion that Squirrel Hill South is the safest neighborhood for kids in Pittsburgh.
